The fonts are distributed under the following copyright:

### Copyright FAQ ###

   1. I don't understand the resale restriction... What gives?

      Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure its
      competitors can't just drop the fonts as is into a font sale system
      and sell them as is. It seems fair that if Bitstream can't make money
      from the Bitstream Vera fonts, their competitors should not be able to
      do so either. You can sell the fonts as part of any software package,
      however.

   2. I want to package these fonts separately for distribution and
      sale as part of a larger software package or system.  Can I do so?

      Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a "larger software package" to begin 
      with, and you aren't selling them independently by themselves. 
      See 1. above.

   3. Are derivative works allowed?
      Yes!

   4. Can I change or add to the font(s)?
      Yes, but you must change the name(s) of the font(s).

   5. Under what terms are derivative works allowed?

      You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the
      quality of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome. We want to
      ensure that if an application has opened a font specifically of these
      names, it gets what it expects (though of course, using fontconfig,
      substitutions could still could have occurred during font
      opening). You must include the Bitstream copyright. Additional
      copyrights can be added, as per copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!

   6. If I have improvements for Bitstream Vera, is it possible they might get 
       adopted in future versions?

      Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has
      provisions for working with Bitstream to ensure quality additions to
      the Bitstream Vera font family. Please contact us if you have such
      additions. Note, that in general, we will want such additions for the
      entire family, not just a single font, and that you'll have to keep
      both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, happy! To make sense to add
      glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in keeping with Vera's
      design. Vera cannot become a "ransom note" font. Jim Lyles will be
      providing a document describing the design elements used in Vera, as a
      guide and aid for people interested in contributing to Vera.

   7. I want to sell a software package that uses these fonts: Can I do so?

      Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your software
      with the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.

   8. If applications have built the names "Bitstream Vera" into them, 
      can I override this somehow to use fonts of my choosing?

      This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source
      systems and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to
      use fontconfig (see www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration,
      selection and substitution; it has provisions for overriding font
      names and subsituting alternatives. An example is provided by the
      supplied local.conf file, which chooses the family Bitstream Vera for
      "sans", "serif" and "monospace".  Other software (e.g., the XFree86
      core server) has other mechanisms for font substitution.

### NOTE THIS ADD-ON ###

The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for software libraries
in the first place. The LGPL has to be considered valid for this artwork
library too.

Nuvola icon theme for KDE 3.x is a special kind of software library, it is an
artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
GUI.

Source code, for this library means:

 * raster png images.

The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly usefull.
With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
containing the elements. You may follow this practice.

The exception in section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
